# nike-responsive-design
conceptional tweak and reimplementation of nike's https://www.nike.com/us/en_us/c/men page.
I decided to add bootstrap 

#TODO Work
I tried to timebox the amount of work I spent on the project but got pretty far here is a list of what needs to be done next
* Finish Base Styles. As you can see from my implementation there are still mistakes in the base screen size. I need to go through and adjust padding and postioning of text as well as add correct background colors where needed.
* Fine Tune Bootstrap. Step one was to grab all the componets, images and text then go through and implement a base html page with all the content. Step 2 was then to go through and add bootstrap to all the components. I did this, but breakpoints, and thresholds are off. I need to go through and fine tune these breakpoints.
* Fine Tune Links. There are some links but not everywhere where I would like. Add these.
* Add VueJS, Webcomponents, or StencilJs to make more components. Some of these design patterns could easily be made into reusable web components so instead of having to code a slough of HTML for a common card pattern all a develop would need to do is just code ```<card></card>``` for example.
