# nike-responsive-design
Here is a conceptional tweak and reimplementation of nike's https://www.nike.com/us/en_us/c/men page. I decided to add bootstrap as a css responsive framework as well as tilt.js and Jquery for some nice card tilting effects. Besides that I tried to keep the library as stripped down of dependacies and tools as possible.

# To Run
Open the index.html file in your favorite browser

# Structure
There is an ```index.html``` file for the main page. I then have two css pages, one ```main.css``` file, where I set standardized components and HTML dom element rules that all other pages should follow. Specific styles to the page that wouldn't be used I set in ```homepage.css```.

# TODO Work
Here is TODO Future Work
* Add VueJS, Webcomponents, or StencilJs to make more HTML components. Some of these design patterns could easily be made into reusable web components so instead of having to code a slough of HTML for a common pattern all a developer would need to do is just code ```<card></card>```. This makes for simipler to read code as well as is a new common web pattern.
